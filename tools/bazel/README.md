# Native AMD64 Bazel build

Bazel builds this repository's REST server, certificate tool and patched klish
CLI from source. Management-common owns CVL/translib, prepared YANG models and
generated Go bindings; Framework consumes those targets and runs its own
YANG-to-REST generator. Runtime and debug TARs feed Docker composition directly.
No target generates a DEB, and the existing Make entry points remain available.

| Target | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `//rest/main:rest_server` | REST executable and generated API routes |
| `//rest/cert:generate_cert` | Certificate tool from the pinned Go SDK source |
| `//models:rest_models`, `:ui`, `:docs` | Generated Go API, UI and API documentation |
| `//CLI:runtime` | Patched klish, matching libraries, command tree and Python assets |
| `//dist:runtime` | Complete legacy install layout under `/usr/sbin` and `/etc/rest_server/ui` |
| `//dist:runtime.debug_symbols` | Symbols split from the same eight deployed ELF files |

The selected configuration is native AMD64 Debian Trixie with Bazel 8.5.1,
Go 1.25.9, Python 3.13 and the shared GCC toolchain. REST compilation preserves
Make's `-gcflags="all=-N -l"` on the target itself, including when another
Bazel root consumes it; the certificate tool keeps normal Go optimization. External native libraries and execution tools use
reviewed package locks. CLI source preparation and compilation use the shared
build-tools runtime; the component lock contains target libraries only.

## Review dependencies

Management Common `1.0.1-05f83dcab8fe2e1a0e0fc37ac172b289d6968e2b` and the
public goyang/ygot owners are available in the maintained SONiC registry after
[Management Common #3](https://github.com/securely1g/sonic-mgmt-common/pull/3),
[registry #214](https://github.com/securely1g/sonic-bazel-registry/pull/214) and
[registry #216](https://github.com/securely1g/sonic-bazel-registry/pull/216).
Source CI and the separate consumer use registry main without a temporary
catalog substitution. The existing immutable archive selection for
[shared CLI execution tools #72](https://github.com/securely1g/sonic-build-infra/pull/72)
remains a separate review dependency; this Management Common adoption does not
change those execution tools.

```sh
bazel build //dist:runtime //dist:runtime.debug_symbols
```

`MODULE.bazel.lock` is generated and ignored; CI retains it as evidence. Package
locks stay checked in. The maintained BUILD targets use the selected Common
module directly, preserving the legacy neighboring-checkout `go.mod` declaration.
`go.bazel.work` preserves the four deployed `golang.org/x` library versions
from the native `go.mod`; Bazel build-tool requirements must not silently upgrade
the REST runtime. Downstream roots load this exported work file, as shown in
`tools/bazel/consumer/MODULE.bazel`. The native `go.mod` and `go.sum` are unchanged.
The public goyang/ygot modules own their shared Go types. Remaining Go dependency
patches are root-only settings, and consuming roots select the owner-exported
patches explicitly. The certificate generator reads its source
from the selected public Go toolchain provider, without assuming an SDK repository
name that only works in this checkout.

## Validation

CI starts from a checkout without a generated module lock. It builds the public
TARs, measures a no-op, independently edits REST source/UI templates/CLI assets,
and checks that only the corresponding outputs change. Restoring each input
must reproduce every original hash.

Klish uses libtool's install/relink step before packaging so its library search
paths name `/usr/sbin/cli/.libs`. A harmless configure-script edit also rebuilds
the same native sources in a new temporary directory and must preserve every
TAR hash; package checks reject temporary build paths in ELF search paths.

`tools/bazel/check_consumer.py` also builds the public runtime/debug TARs from an
independent root, composing them with Common data as a Docker consumer does. It
runs five owner package/generator/installed-service tests and retains their actual
reports and generated resolution lock. The source test uses explicit local module
overrides for this checkout and its already-verified infra source; separate registry
CI validates the published archive and version. Neither test rebuilds the owner
inside a consumer-owned rule.

The original REST suite keeps its seven opt-in SSH/TACACS authentication skips;
those require configured user accounts and are not silently enabled against the
CI host. The legacy `rest/main/main_test.go` is a long-running coverage daemon,
so `//rest/main:coverage_server` is manual. The installed-service test instead
starts the actual packaged executable with private Redis, generated certificates
and the installed models/UI, then checks TLS and RESTCONF responses.

The four original OpenAPI golden comparisons, CLI client assertions, XML
preparation, TLS URL/CA checks and package contracts run separately. The full
package check compares generated assets and install paths, ownership, modes,
symlinks, architecture and every ELF/debug pair. These source/TAR checks do not
claim Docker integration, PAM/TACACS authentication or VS image validation.

`models/codegen.config` is a declared input. The current four empty settings are
supported; nonempty exclusions/client selections and handwritten OpenAPI specs
fail clearly until their corresponding generator targets are declared.
